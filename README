This folder contains a D-Bus/Qt-based chat Demo adapted from:

  - http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/D-Bus/CustomTypes

To build/run it, you can either change to the 'cpp' folder and type:

  qmake
  make
  ./DBusChat

or, if you prefer CMake (and why wouldn't you!), execute these commands from
the top-level folder:

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ../cpp
  make
  ./DBusChat

I'm be much obliged if someone could tell me why starting 'DBusChat', and then
running 'test/test_chat.py', generates the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
